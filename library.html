            <div class="inner-cont"> The SpaceX Mars program is a set of projects through which the aerospace company
                SpaceX hopes to facilitate the colonization of Mars. The company claims that this is necessary for the
                long-term survival of the human species and that its Mars program, including the ongoing development of
                the SpaceX Starship, will reduce space transportation costs, thereby making travel to Mars a more
                realistic possibility. The establishment of Mars Base Alpha will be enabled with the development of
                SpaceX's Starship Super Heavy, capable to bring large quantity of cargo and passengers to the surface of
                Mars. Initially there were four regions considered by SpaceX for the landing site – Deuteronilus Mensae,
                Phlegra Montes, Utopia Planitia and Southern Arcadia Planitia.</div>

                In the year 2030, James Holden and team plan on being the first to go to the planet Jupiter and start
                the building of the Corner Stone Station, named for the mission of it being the last stop for deep space
                travel. “This Station was my little boy dream,” James said, “I thought I would have to start off with
                mars, but Elon has started that for me and with NASA’s Gateway project of a station around the moon,
                this project will be even easier. I can see use traveling to Mars and Jupiter for science and
                challenging the human condition like we do when we send scientist to Antarctica.”

                The current hypothesis for the origin and functioning of the sun is the gravity-driven ‘Thermonuclear’

                The current hypothesis for the origin and functioning of the sun is the gravity-driven ‘Thermonuclear’
                model. It is taught in every school on Earth. It has never been proven.<br>
                There is another quite different hypothesis, the 'Electric Sun' model, which has been 250 years in the
                making. It also has never been proven.<br>
                Until recently there has been no mechanism by which we could test either hypothesis.
                In 2012 at a conference exploring the electrical nature of deep space Montgomery Childs proposed a way
                the Electric Sun Model could be tested.<br>
                Montgomery Childs: "Two years of research has led me to the conclusion that the Electric Sun Model might
                be boiled down to a fundamental process:<br>
                "Charged plasma affecting matter of a different electrical potential.”
