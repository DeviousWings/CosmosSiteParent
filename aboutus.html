        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This site will allow you to easily browse each topic of everything dealing with space, physics, and science
            that pertains to being a Space Exploring Species and stewards of that right. This site will have all the
            current
            information, theories, and studies for each subject that will be easily browsable for your enjoyment and
            research. Planets, stars, chemistry, physics, etc.</p>
        <p>The library will be able to help you on your research. Any hobbyist will have the same information as the
            major
            researchers in the field. This is so the normal hobbyist can also do the same research and submit their own
            to
            help build the information and brainstorm ideas. This way we get a faster results and more cohesive
            community.
        </p>
        <h3>Activates</h3>
        <p>As I mentioned before people will be able to submit their research and testing on the site. There will be a
            part
            of the site that is like a Facebook that allows hobbyists and researchers to post their discoveries. Video,
            blogs, pictures, and even polls. This will be a place where these hobbyists can come together solely for
            these
            studies. To help us to be a greater civilization, scientifically speaking.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will have conferences where people can come to network, build, and interact sociably with each other. We
            believe that face to face interactions hold a better place in the human mind and heart then it could ever
            when
            dealing solely online.
        </p>
        <h3>What you will find</h3>
        <p>The information that is necessary to complete any actions on this site will be all the data, no opinions
            (unless
            it is in a theories boards). As such, the greatest and most controversial topic is climate change. When you
            put
            in any data about the changing climate, you must also put the data “outside” the normal studies. Such as
            what
            was the sun doing, the electromagnetic galactic sheet, the magnetic field of the earth. This site will not
            blame
            humans or one chemical for the problems that arise, in such formats as climate change and the controversy
            from
            it. If you say the earth will flood, you must have the data to back that up. This is for research, this is
            for
            information, this is for understanding the world around us. Meaning if your information conflicts with the
            known, not the theory, rules of nature, (physics, biology, chemistry, etc.) it will be considered wrong and
            non-information. It will not be excepted on the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are a site of information, not opinion or “humans are the disease” type scenarios. We will seek only pure
            truth. Pure facts. Nothing less will suffice.
        </p>
        <p>
            We hope visitors will come to our site for the fact we will not play a bios, political game to get funding,
            affirm your opinions, or play to the dooms day of death. No altering information for you views. Until the
            information is cross examined by multiple sources, it will not be fact. It will be hard for information to
            be
            fact, but we do not want to have false information that causes nothing but strife. This will be the place
            where
            even those who do not study this field will be able to understand it. If a dooms day is every predicted on
            this
            site, it is because of the facts and pure truth of the data that was collected and studied. Until proven
            otherwise, everything is a theory and what is already known, and truth is already proven to be fact. You can
            study what is already known and add to the known, but that does not change the truth of the known or facts.
            Science is allowed to be questions. Time goes on and things will change.
        </p>
        <p>
            Earth, the Sun, Mars, and the cosmos is in an eternal change as time goes by, just like us humans are. We
            are
            the recorders of that change. The scribes of the cosmos. Understanding what we see around us to be better
            stewards and rulers of the world and cosmos. As we are a religious base minded researcher group, we believe
            science is not to push the boundaries of God, but to understand the boundaries set for us. To understand the
            stewardship He has granted us.
