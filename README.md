<p>The purpose of this site is to have a Library of Alexandria of Space Exploration. The technologies, the science,
    the theories and their timelines of discovery and lifetime. We will be going place to place to each space project
    to show what is being studied and the discoveries that they are making. Documenting what the top companies are
    doing for everyone to be able to not only enjoy space themselves, but how they are making us a space traveling
    species.
    <br>
    <br>
    We will also be exploring our own theories. This is also a Research and Development company. Along with
    documenting all the discoveries the big hats are making, we wish to do it ourselves. We will be building,
    studying, and creating our own image and ideas of what a space expletory spices might look like. Right now, we are
    just in the beginning phase of our projects to get them off the ground.
    <br>
    <br>
    We would also like to get you involved. Just like the rules in the Library of Alexandria, we will use the same
    rule. If you wish to take knowledge from our library, you must input some of your knowledge as well (do not worry,
    you are still able to see our content). But we want to get this in a global scale of study. Input your ideas so
    that they can be crossed examined and put into the library!

<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>This site is for all those who wish to read and understand the current happenings in the Space Industry. We hope
    to attract a lot of students, professor, curious people, and those who are just gazers out of hobby. News,
    theories, facts, and current studies that the major companies and science teams are currently doing. This will be
    the one stop shop for everything dealing with the Space Industry.
    <br>
    <br>
    As we are also a Research and Development team, we hope to attract those who wish to do research as well and
    develop more methods to be used by everyone to explore and discover. We invite all to participate in the
    discussions, theories, and studies we will be doing on this site.
    <br>
    <br>
    Having a website is great, but a goal we have is to make this library physical, and really, how do you wish to
    explore and the studies of space? On your computer or in real life. Once we get to a point, we will be creating an
    actual library of books of studies, theories, research and physical items like rockets, habitats, and future
    technologies that will progress our desires to explore and understand deep space.
